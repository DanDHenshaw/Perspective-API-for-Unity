# Perspective API for Unity
Perspective API can help mitigate toxicity and ensure healthy dialogue online.

## Instructions
You can install this package in two ways.
### A) Package Manager (GIT URL)
The suggested way to install this package is through the Unity's Package Manager itself, via a GIT url. This way, you will be notified once new versions get released, and you will be able to download them directly from the Unity Editor.

-> **The GIT URL you need to add to the Package manager is the following** (copy and paste it): **https://github.com/DanDHenshaw/Perspective-API-for-Unity.git**

For more info on how to install custom packages from a GIT Url, please read here: https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui-giturl.html

### B) Manual Install
You can also install this package manually, by copying the source files directly into your project's assets folder. (You'd have to do this every time there is a new update.)

### Setup
After the installation, you must setup the package.
1. In Unity, head over the menu item "Tools/PerspectiveAPI/Data/Create".
2. Perspective API is now installed but you must include your own API key. You can do this by editing the "PerspectiveData" file located in "Assets/PerspectiveAPI".
3. APIs must be generated through "Google Cloud Platform" and you must request API access. Please read here: https://developers.perspectiveapi.com/s/docs-get-started?language=en_US
